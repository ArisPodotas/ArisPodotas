- 👋 Hi, I’m Aris
- I belive that coding and using computers is a skill that can supplement any field of human endeavour and that is why I decided to start learning and working with computers.
- It was a nice coincidence that I happen to enjoy working on the computer, not just in the theoretical but also the keyboard it's quite enjoyable to learn how to type faster and be more productive for instance.
- Very frequently I find that any new project I start the first ideas regarding the workflow involve more so the computations than the practical for reasons of optimisation.
- I to this day have a big hardware issue regarding my work envoiroment but I have intentions of changing that soon.

- 👀 I’m interested in Biology big data and Evolution.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C on the basis of the syllabus of the CS50x course from Harvard University and web development in my personal endeavours for now...
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Projects that involve simulating evolution and biolagical data.
- 📫 How to reach me: a.Podotas@gmail.com
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm learning another language, it's called Japanese.
